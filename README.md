# My p5js projects

**Note: all of the below projects use the p5js version 1.11.8. They will, hopefully, be updated to version 2 in the future. Also, thanks to p5js for all of this!**

There's not much to say here so yeah.  
All projects here with the exception of /DigiPen are HTML websites.  
I am not responsible for badly written code.  

Most of these projects were created in Summer 2025 for the DigiPen Intro to Computer Science class (see DigiPen section). Some of these (i.e. game, leaves) are maintained slightly more, but do not expect many updates unless the project is dead.

I will probably update this in early 2026 (?) as p5js v2 is made the primary version and v1 is deprecated. 

## game

https://thatpanda0.github.io/p5js/game/

Somewhat of a basic shooter game.  
You are a purple ball and you attempt to gain points via destroying red balls, which shoot bullets at you.  
Use WASD to move, click to shoot, P for pausing.  

There are a few issues with lag or out-of-focus window because of badly written code, but it should work for the most part. Also not touch-compatible because I was lazy.


## platformer

https://thatpanda0.github.io/p5js/platformer/

Exactly what it sounds like. A platformer (well, actually, an engine because no end). Use WASD or arrow keys to move.  
Wall "hugging" and wall climbing are implemented, and there is no current end of the level.

## leaves

https://thatpanda0.github.io/p5js/leaves/

Intended as a clock of sorts, has a light and dark mode.  
Readibility of the clock is questionable, but generally fine.

## DigiPen

https://thatpanda0.github.io/p5js/DigiPen/[SOMETHING].js

These files are not projects intended to be ran in the browser but instead using p5js editor at  
https://editor.p5js.org

Originally made for the Intro to Computer Science (DigiPen (WANIC)) class (formally known as SWZ101), these projects are the solutions I came up with for projects. My final project was "game" (the first section/folder of this repo).
